Keeping yourself busy is always a good thing. With this in mind I wanted to challenge myself by making 99 small interactive tools/games/experiments using HTML5 canvas in 99 days. I got inspiration from Jennifer Dewalt (180 websites in 180 days).

You can check the progress of the challenge on GitHub (and contribute if you want!).
